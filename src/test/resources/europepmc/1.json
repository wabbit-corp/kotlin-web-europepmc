        "abstractText": "Wetland parks are designed to support urban ecological protection, flood control and human well-being. Existing research mainly focuses on their influence on ecology and economy. However, their influence on human well-being and health is rarely studied. In China, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (Peak), people were very concerned about health, while at the same time wetland parks which are generally considered beneficial to health were closed. Thus, this study explores the publicâ€™s perception of the health effects of visiting wetland parks and the impact of the pandemic on the perception. From March 5th to 8th, 2020, before the Peak in China was over, 1,400 respondents participated in a nationwide online survey. It was found that the perceived benefits from visiting wetland parks were higher in terms of mental health than in physical health. Also, the perceived health benefits of wetland parks after the Peak were slightly higher than before the pandemic. The results highlight that wildlife habitat services were considered to be the most important ecosystem services that promote the perceived health benefits. Interestingly, the perceived health benefits of wetland parks by health experts appear to be lower than in other groups, indicating that the health benefits of visiting wetland parks may be overestimated by lay-people or underestimated by health experts. The results provide empirical evidence for managing ecosystem services as delivered by these urban wetlands, in the context of COVID-19 or potential future pandemics, for promoting public health.",

This study aimed to evaluate the association between COVID-19 infection and/or COVID-19 vaccination with SAT.<h4>Methods</h4>A population of 3 million adults insured by Clalit Health Services (CHS) was evaluated from March 2020 to September 2022. Patients with a new diagnosis of SAT were identified and matched in a 1:10 ratio to a control group. Each control was assigned an index date that was identical to that of their matched case, defined as the date of SAT diagnosis. Multivariate conditional logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between COVID-19 infection, vaccine, and thyroiditis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 3,221 patients with SAT were matched with 32,210 controls. Rates of COVID-19 vaccination (first, second, or third dose) and COVID-19 infection were evaluated prior to the date of SAT diagnosis (disease group) or index date (control group) to detect a possible association. No difference was detected between the groups in relation to vaccinations at the 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days'time points (p=0.880/0.335/0.174 respectively). No difference was found between groups in relation to COVID-19 infection at these time points (p=0.735/0.362/0.956 respectively). There was higher use of medications for the treatment of thyroiditis, including NSAIDs (28.6% vs. 7.9%, p<0.01), steroids (10.3% vs. 1.8%, p<0.01), and beta-blockers (18.3% vs. 5.4%, p<0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Based on this large population study, no association was found between COVID-19 infection and/or the COVID-19 vaccine and SAT.",

The patients were divided into the 'good blood glucose control' group and the 'poor blood glucose control' group based on an assessment of their blood glucose control. The clinical data, computed tomography (CT) appearance and score and the severity of COVID-19 infection of the two groups were compared, with the severity of COVID-19 infection being the dependent variable to analyse other influencing factors.<h4>Results</h4>The group with poor blood glucose control showed a higher lobar involvement degree and total CT severity score (CTSS) than the group with good blood glucose control (13.30?Â±?5.25 vs. 10.38?Â±?4.84, p?<?0.05). The two groups exhibited no statistically significant differences in blood lymphocyte, leukocyte, C-reaction protein, pleural effusion, consolidation, ground glass opacity or crazy-paving signs. Logistic regression analysis showed that the total CTSS significantly influences the clinical severity of patients (odds ratio 1.585, p?<?0.05), whereas fasting plasma glucose and blood glucose control are not independent factors influencing clinical severity (both p?>?0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) of CTSS prediction of critical COVID-19 was 0.895 with sensitivity of 79.3% and specificity of 88.1% when the threshold value is 12.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Blood glucose control is significantly correlated with the CTSS; the higher the blood glucose is, the more severe the lung manifestation. The CTSS can also be used to evaluate and predict the clinical severity of COVID-19.",

We also analyzed fake news and facts, and Twitter engagement to understand peopleâ€™s perceptions and beliefs that determine public health literacy. Methods We collected 3,489,367 tweets data from January 2020 to August 2021. We analyzed factual and fake news using the string comparison method. The difflib library was used to measure similarity. The userâ€™s engagement was analyzed by averaging the engagement metrics of tweets, retweets, favorites, replies, and posts shared with sentiments and opinions regarding COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. Result Positive sentiments on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination dominated, however, the negative sentiments increased during the beginning of the implementation of restrictions on community activities (PPKM).Â  The tweets were dominated by the importance of health protocols (washing hands, keeping distance, and wearing masks). Several types of vaccines were on top of the word count in the vaccine subtopic. Acceptance of the vaccination increased during the studied period, and the fake news was overweighed by the facts. The tweets were dynamic and showed that the engaged topics were changed from the nature of COVID-19 to the vaccination and virus mutation which peaked in the early and middle terms of 2021. The public sentiment and engagement were shifted from hesitancy to anxiety towards the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, whilst changed again into wariness on an uprising of the delta variant. Conclusion Understanding public sentiment and opinion can help policymakers to plan the best strategy to cope with the pandemic. Positive sentiments and fact-based opinions on COVID-19, and COVID-19 vaccination had been shown predominantly. However, sufficient health literacy levels could yet be predicted and sought for further study.",

This study aimed to assess the COVID-19 protection status of children and explored the relationship between household socio-economic status and COVID-19 morbidity and preventive measures, including vaccination and mask-wearing, in two cities in Iran.<h4>Method</h4>A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July to October 2022 among 7 to 18-year-old children and their families in Tehran and Karaj. A total of 3,022 samples were selected using stratified multistage cluster sampling. Data were collected through interviews with children and adults, using questionnaires and was analyzed with Stata software version 14.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis focused on 2,878 children with a median age of 12. Over half (54%) reported that the pandemic negatively affected their family's financial status, with 45% describing its impact on children's needs as negative or very negative. Just under 50% of respondents consistently wore masks during the study period, and around 54% had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for not getting vaccinated included concerns about side effects, ineligibility for the target age group, and overcrowding at vaccination sites. The odds of not getting vaccinated were significantly lower for children aged 15-18, with boys more likely to refuse vaccination than girls.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The financial impact of the pandemic in Iran affected families' ability to meet their children's needs. Moreover, low vaccination acceptance rates increased children's vulnerability to health problems and contributed to COVID-19 infections. Efforts should be made to increase vaccination acceptance, particularly among immigrant populations.",

The level of fear, anxiety and hopelessness was higher among women, first-grade students, those who did not receive the Covid-19 vaccine, those who have caught in Covid-19 before, and those who have lost a family due to Covid-19.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It is thought that the increase in the awareness level of young adolescents about Covid-19 improves preventive health behaviors and enables the development of positive behaviors related to the disease.",

Those eligible for this analysis presented for delivery with a current or previous asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome was moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19 during the delivery admission through 42 days postpartum. The prediction model was developed and internally validated using stratified cross-validation with stepwise backward elimination, incorporating only variables that were known on the day of hospital admission.<h4>Results</h4>?Of the 2,818 patients included, 26 (0.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-1.3%) developed moderate-severe-critical COVID-19 during the study period. Variables in the prediction model were gestational age at delivery admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.08-1.22 per 1-week decrease), a hypertensive disorder in a prior pregnancy (aOR 3.05; 95% CI, 1.25-7.46), and systolic blood pressure at admission (aOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05 per mm Hg increase). This model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72-0.91).<h4>Conclusion</h4>?Among individuals presenting for delivery who had asymptomatic-mild COVID-19, gestational age at delivery admission, a hypertensive disorder in a prior pregnancy, and systolic blood pressure at admission were predictive of delivering with moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19. This prediction model may be a useful tool to optimize resources for SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant individuals admitted for delivery.<h4>Key points</h4>Â· Three factors were associated with delivery with more severe COVID-19.. Â· The developed model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 and model fit was good.. Â· The model may be useful tool for SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnancies admitted for delivery..",

Vaccine rollout was grouped into four stages with predefined enrolment periods. Each stage included all individuals eligible for vaccination, with no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccine at the start date. Vaccination status was used as a time-varying exposure. Outcomes included heart failure (HF), venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thrombosis/thromboembolism (ATE) recorded in four time windows after SARS-CoV-2 infection: 0-30, 31-90, 91-180 and 181-365?days. Propensity score overlap weighting and empirical calibration were used to minimise observed and unobserved confounding, respectively.Fine-Gray models estimated subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR). Random effect meta-analyses were conducted across staggered cohorts and databases.<h4>Results</h4>The study included 10.17?million vaccinated and 10.39?million unvaccinated people. Vaccination was associated with reduced risks of acute (30-day) and post-acute COVID-19 VTE, ATE and HF: for example, meta-analytic sHR of 0.22 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.29), 0.53 (0.44 to 0.63) and 0.45 (0.38 to 0.53), respectively, for 0-30?days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while in the 91-180?days sHR were 0.53 (0.40 to 0.70), 0.72 (0.58 to 0.88) and 0.61 (0.51 to 0.73), respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>COVID-19 vaccination reduced the risk of post-COVID-19 cardiac and thromboembolic outcomes. These effects were more pronounced for acute COVID-19 outcomes, consistent with known reductions in disease severity following breakthrough versus unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

        "abstractText": "<h4>Objectives</h4>The extent to which care quality influenced outcomes for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 is unknown. Our objective was to determine if prepandemic hospital quality is associated with mortality among Medicare patients hospitalised with COVID-19.<h4>Design</h4>This is a retrospective observational study. We calculated hospital-level risk-standardised in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates (risk-standardised mortality rates, RSMRs) for patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and correlation coefficients between RSMRs and pre-COVID-19 hospital quality, overall and stratified by hospital characteristics.<h4>Setting</h4>Short-term acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals in the USA.<h4>Participants</h4>Hospitalised Medicare beneficiaries (Fee-For-Service and Medicare Advantage) age 65 and older hospitalised with COVID-19, discharged between 1 April 2020 and 30 September 2021.<h4>Intervention/exposure</h4>Pre-COVID-19 hospital quality.<h4>Outcomes</h4>Risk-standardised COVID-19 in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates (RSMRs).<h4>Results</h4>In-hospital (n=4256) RSMRs for Medicare patients hospitalised with COVID-19 (April 2020-September 2021) ranged from 4.5% to 59.9% (median 18.2%; IQR 14.7%-23.7%); 30-day RSMRs ranged from 12.9% to 56.2% (IQR 24.6%-30.6%). COVID-19 RSMRs were negatively correlated with star rating summary scores (in-hospital correlation coefficient -0.41, p<0.0001; 30 days -0.38, p<0.0001). Correlations with in-hospital RSMRs were strongest for patient experience (-0.39, p<0.0001) and timely and effective care (-0.30, p<0.0001) group scores; 30-day RSMRs were strongest for patient experience (-0.34, p<0.0001) and mortality (-0.33, p<0.0001) groups. Patients admitted to 1-star hospitals had higher odds of mortality (in-hospital OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.83 to 1.91; 30-day OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.48) compared with 5-star hospitals. If all hospitals performed like an average 5-star hospital, we estimate 38?000 fewer COVID-19-related deaths would have occurred between April 2020 and September 2021.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Hospitals with better prepandemic quality may have care structures and processes that allowed for better care delivery and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the relationship between pre-COVID-19 hospital quality and COVID-19 outcomes will allow policy-makers and hospitals better prepare for future public health emergencies.",

        "abstractText": "The effects of COVID-19 vaccination on short-term and long-term cerebrovascular risks among COVID-19 survivors remained unknown. We conducted a national multi-center retrospective cohort study with 151?597 vaccinated and 151?597 unvaccinated COVID-19 patients using the TriNetX database, from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2023. Patients baseline characteristics were balanced with propensity score matching (PSM). The outcomes were incident cerebrovascular diseases occurred between 1st and 30th days (short-term) after COVID-19 diagnosis. Nine subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential effect modifications. We performed six sensitivity analyses, including evaluation of outcomes between 1st to 180th days, accounting for competing risk, and incorporating different variant timeline to test the robustness of our results. Kaplan-Meier curves and Log-Rank tests were performed to evaluate survival difference. Cox proportional hazards regressions were adopted to estimate the PSM-adjusted hazard ratios (HR). The overall short-term cerebrovascular risks were lower in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.56-0.77), specifically cerebral infarction (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.48-0.79), occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.53-0.98), other cerebrovascular diseases (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.42-0.77), and sequelae of cerebrovascular disease (HR: 0.39, 95% CI:0.23-0.68). Similarly, the overall cerebrovascular risks were lower in those vaccinated among most subgroups. The long-term outcomes, though slightly attenuated, were consistent (HR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73-0.87). Full 2-dose vaccination was associated with a further reduced risk of cerebrovascular diseases (HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.50-0.80) compared to unvaccinated patients. Unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors have significantly higher cerebrovascular risks than their vaccinated counterparts. Thus, clinicians are recommended to monitor this population closely for stroke events during postinfection follow-up.",

Unexpected factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic might contribute for increasing the complexity of such interactions and shift consumption patterns. This study aimed at characterizing the consumption of fish in the Brazilian territory, identifying factors that influence such consumption and investigating how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the country's consumption pattern. A closed and semi-structured questionnaire was applied and gathered responses from 1763 Brazilian participants from all the country's macro-regions, regarding fish consumption and factors affecting it. Data were presented descriptively and analyzed by means of a multivariate approach. Three patterns of fish meat consumption were identified in the study. Northern participants consume this foodstuff in recommended amounts by dietary guidelines in higher proportions than other regions. In general, during the pandemic most respondents did not change their fish consumption (59.7%) and declared that no risks were associated with consuming this foodstuff (65.6%). It was found that the origin of fish is a major driver of consumption, whereas from 49.2% (Southeast and Midwest) to 58.2% (North) of the population would increase their consumption in case the origin of the foodstuff was declared. Fish consumption in Brazil is influenced by multiple factors and it can be stimulated by exploring differences existing among the territory's macro-regions.",

        "abstractText": "The Circumpolar region, comprising the Arctic territories encircling the North Pole, is home to diverse Indigenous cultures facing unique socio-economic challenges. Indigenous communities such as the Inuit, SÃ¡mi, Athabaskan, Gwitchin, and Russian Arctic groups exhibit rich traditions and adaptive practices tied to their environments. Environmental diversity, from icy tundra to boreal forests, influences livelihoods and biodiversity, while significant socio-economic disparities persist, impacting access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. Against this backdrop, the global COVID-19 pandemic accentuated the intersection of environment, culture, and health in remote Arctic regions, presenting distinct challenges and opportunities. Initiated by a collaborative research project led by Fulbright Arctic Initiative Alumni, this special issue of the International Journal of Circumpolar Health explores the impacts of COVID-19 on Arctic Indigenous and rural communities. Building on previous work and recommendations, the issue features community case studies, highlighting community experiences and collaborative approaches to understand and address the pandemic's effects. The authors highlight both positive and negative societal outcomes, presenting community-driven models and evidence-based practices to inform pan-Arctic collaboration and decision-making in public health emergencies. Through sharing these insights, the special issue aims to privilege local and Indigenous knowledge systems, elevates community responses to complex and multifaceted challenges, and contributes to the evidence base on global pandemic response.",

        "abstractText": "<h4>Objective</h4>Current literature on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) research presents gaps and opportunities to investigate the psychological experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) serving in mass trauma situations. We aimed to measure perceived stress, burnout, and resilience in Kashmiri HCWs and explore the relationship of burnout with sociodemographic, work-related, and pandemic-related factors.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. Data were collected by circulating a web-based questionnaire among HCWs across primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare levels in Kashmir, India. The questionnaire consisted of sections on personal, work-related, and pandemic-related variables as well as validated instruments to measure perceived stress, burnout, and resilience.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 514 valid responses were received. More than 80 percent of HCWs had moderate to high perceived stress. The prevalence of personal, work-related, and client-related burnouts was 68, 48.6, and 46 percent, respectively. Resilience was negatively correlated with stress and burnout. Younger (18-28 years), unmarried HCWs, especially junior residents and nurses, had higher burnout levels. Redeployment to deliver COVID-19 duties, unpredictability in work schedule, tested positive for COVID-19, and spending time in isolation/quarantine were also found to be significant risk factors for developing burnout.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Nearly half of the HCWs suffered from burnout, and more than half had moderate to high perceived stress. In addition to pre-existing risk factors of burnout, the pandemic seems to have introduced more occupational risk factors in this disaster-affected area. Lessons learnt from COVID-19 pandemic may help guide need-based intervention strategies designed for specific target population rather than a one size fits all approach.",

This study examined the association between perceived racial-ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare and willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.<h4>Methods</h4>This study used data from REACH-US, a nationally representative online survey of a large, diverse sample of U.S. adults (N=5145 January 26, 2021-March 3, 2021). Confirmatory factor and regression analyses examined a latent factor of perceived racial-ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare, whether the factor was associated with willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and whether associations varied across racial-ethnic groups reported as probit estimates (B) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).<h4>Results</h4>Perceived racial-ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare were highest among Black/African American adults (mean latent factor score: 0.65?Â±?0.43) and lowest among White adults (mean latent factor score: 0.04?Â±?0.67). Black/African American (B = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.19, 0.03) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (B = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.23, 0.07) adults who perceived greater racial-ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare were less willing than participants who perceived lower inequities. In contrast, American Indian/Alaska Native (B = 0.15; 95% CI = -0.01, 0.30), Asian (B = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.31), Hispanic/Latino (English language preference) (B = 0.22; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.43), Multiracial (B = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.09, 0.36), and White (B = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.43) adults who perceived greater racial-ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare were more willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine than participants perceiving higher inequities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Greater perceived racial-ethnic inequities in COVID-19 healthcare were associated with less willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among Black/African American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander adults.",

        "abstractText": "<h4>Background: </h4> This bibliometric analysis examines the top 50 most-cited articles on COVID-19 complications, offering insights into the multifaceted impact of the virus. Since its emergence in Wuhan in December 2019, COVID-19 has evolved into a global health crisis, with over 770 million confirmed cases and 6.9 million deaths as of September 2023. Initially recognized as a respiratory illness causing pneumonia and ARDS, its diverse complications extend to cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, hematological, neurological, endocrinological, ophthalmological, hepatobiliary, and dermatological systems. Methods Identifying the top 50 articles from a pool of 5940 in Scopus, the analysis spans November 2019 to July 2021, employing terms related to COVID-19 and complications. Rigorous review criteria excluded non-relevant studies, basic science research, and animal models. The authors independently reviewed articles, considering factors like title, citations, publication year, journal, impact factor, authors, study details, and patient demographics. Results The focus is primarily on 2020 publications (96%), with all articles being open access. Leading journals include The Lancet, NEJM, and JAMA, with prominent contributions from Internal Medicine (46.9%) and Pulmonary Medicine (14.5%). China played a major role (34.9%), followed by France and Belgium. Clinical features were the primary study topic (68%), often utilizing retrospective designs (24%). Among 22,477 patients analyzed, 54.8% were male, with the most common age group being 26-65 years (63.2%). Complications of COVID-19 affected 13.9% of patients, with a recovery rate of 57.8%. Conclusion Analyzing these top-cited articles offers clinicians and researchers a comprehensive, timely understanding of influential COVID-19 literature. This approach uncovers attributes contributing to high citations and provides authors with valuable insights for crafting impactful research. As a strategic tool, this analysis facilitates staying updated and making meaningful contributions to the dynamic field of COVID-19 research.",

After four months, simultaneous binuclear myocardial scintigraphy of thallium and BMIPP showed that the mismatch had disappeared. We considered that there may be other factors specific to COVID-19 infection in addition to the stress associated with infection and reviewed the literature.",

        "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to challenge the health workforce and societies worldwide. Favipiravir was suggested by some experts to be effective and safe to use in COVID-19. Although this drug has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is still unclear if it has a definite role in the treatment of COVID-19.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effects of favipiravir compared to no treatment, supportive treatment, or other experimental antiviral treatment in people with acute COVID-19.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, and three other databases, up to 18 July 2023.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We searched for RCTs evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in treating people with COVID-19.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for data collection and analysis. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.<h4>Main results</h4>We included 25 trials that randomized 5750 adults (most under 60 years of age). The trials were conducted in Bahrain, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, the UK, and the USA. Most participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate disease (89%). Twenty-two of the 25 trials investigated the role of favipiravir compared to placebo or standard of care, whilst lopinavir/ritonavir was the comparator in two trials, and umifenovir in one trial. Most trials (24 of 25) initiated favipiravir at 1600 mg or 1800 mg twice daily for the first day, followed by 600 mg to 800 mg twice a day. The duration of treatment varied from five to 14 days. We do not know whether favipiravir reduces all-cause mortality at 28 to 30 days, or in-hospital (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.46; 11 trials, 3459 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We do not know if favipiravir reduces the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; 8 trials, 1383 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Favipiravir may make little to no difference in the need for admission to hospital (if ambulatory) (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.46; 4 trials, 670 participants; low-certainty evidence). We do not know if favipiravir reduces the time to clinical improvement (defined as time to a 2-point reduction in patients' admission status on the WHO's ordinal scale) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.13, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.83; 4 trials, 721 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Favipiravir may make little to no difference to the progression to oxygen therapy (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.75; 2 trials, 543 participants; low-certainty evidence). Favipiravir may lead to an overall increased incidence of adverse events (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54; 18 trials, 4699 participants; low-certainty evidence), but may result in little to no difference inserious adverse eventsattributable to the drug (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.42; 12 trials, 3317 participants; low-certainty evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>The low- to very low-certainty evidence means that we do not know whether favipiravir is efficacious in people with COVID-19 illness, irrespective of severity or admission status. Treatment with favipiravir may result in an overall increase in the incidence of adverse events but may not result in serious adverse events.",

This study was conducted to find out the perceptions about second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among Indian adults.<h4>Methods</h4>An online-survey-based cross-sectional study was conducted over 3 weeks from April 21, 2021 to May 11, 2021. Information regarding sociodemographic profile, perceptions about COVID-19 during second wave, perceptions and practices related to COVID-19 vaccination, COVID-19 appropriate behavior, and government's response to the pandemic was collected. Descriptive analysis was performed.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 408 study participants were included. Mean age of the study participants was 29.2 Â± 10.4 years. Around 92.6 percent (378) of respondents agreed that COVID-19 in 2021 is different from 2020. Perceived reasons for increased severity and cases were change in virus characteristics; social, religious, and political gatherings; and complacent behavior by people. Three-fourth (311, 76.2 percent) of the study participants agreed that vaccines have a positive role against COVID-19. Majority of the study participants (329, 80.6 percent) concurred that lockdown restrictions help in control of the pandemic. About 60.3 percent (246) of respondents had less trust on government post this pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19 times.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The public perception about reasons for second wave in India acknowledges both human and virus factors and highlights the importance of shared responsibility between citizens and government for controlling the pandemic.",

        "abstractText": "<h4>Background: </h4> Vaccine safety monitoring systems worldwide have reported cases of venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboembolism following a COVID-19 vaccination. However, evidence shows that the association between thromboembolism and SARS-CoV-2 infection is stronger, compared to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Hence, weighing the risks and benefits of vaccination should also encounter the roles of vaccination in reducing infection rate, and potentially indirectly lowering the risk of thromboembolism caused by infection. <h4>Methods:</h4> We conducted a self-controlled case series study (SCCS) from Dec 1st 2020 to 31st August 2022 (before the bivalent vaccine was available) to examinate the association between the first two doses Pfizer/Moderna vaccination and thrombotic events among patients in Corewell Health East (CHE, formerly known as Beaumont Health) healthcare system. We also investigated the effect SARS-CoV-2 infection on the risk of thrombosis events and observed a significant increased risk using the SCCS design. However, because of misclassification bias, SCCS indeed overestimated incidence rate ratio (IRR) of acute event after infection, we then proposed a case-control study addressing this misclassification issues and obtained odd ratio comparing effect of exposure on thrombosis and a subset of controls group. Finally, we analyzed the risk of thromboembolism between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups by a simple diagram, explaining possible factors that affects the probability of experiencing an acute thromboembolism event after a COVID-19 vaccination. <h4>Results:</h4> Using EHR data at Corewell East, we found an increased risk of thrombosis after the first two doses of COVID-19 vaccination, with incidence rate ratios after the first dose is 1.16 (CI: [1.04, 1.29]), and after the second dose of 1.19 (CI: [1.07,1.32]). The association between thromboembolism and SARS-Cov-2 infection depends on prior vaccination status, as the conditional OR among unvaccinated and vaccinated groups are 1.77 (CI: [1.48,\\ 2.1]) and 1.34 (CI: [1.09,\\ 1.66]) respectively. Encountering the vaccine efficacy (VE), receiving the COVID-19 vaccine decreases the risk of thromboembolism, and the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines are much stronger in the period of high infection rate.",

Although pneumonia is the most common manifestation of COVID-19 and was initially introduced as a respiratory infection, in fact, the infection of COVID-19 is a subset of complications and damage to various organs. There are several reports of cardiac involvement with COVID-19. A wide range of cardiac complications may occur following COVID-19 infection, including systolic heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. There are various hypotheses about the pathophysiology of cardiovascular involvement by this virus. At the top of these hypotheses is the release of cytokines to the heart. Although there are other assumptions, considering that one of the causes of death in patients with COVID-19 is arrhythmia. It is necessary to know correctly about its pathophysiology and etiology. Therefore, in this study, we have reviewed the articles of recent years in the field of pathophysiology and etiology of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 infection. The purpose of this study was to provide a basis for a correct and more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 infection.",
